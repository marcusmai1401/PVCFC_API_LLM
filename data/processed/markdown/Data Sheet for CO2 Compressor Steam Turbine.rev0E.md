3. Final data shall be furnished by turbine vendor.
4. Estimated data, to be confirmed by vendor.
5. the extraction flow in normal operation has been calculated in order to have a total enthalpic content equal to
57950 XHsteam(t. p)=49280 kW. Therefore, if the extraction temperature is different from estimated one the total flow will be recalculated by the mfr. in order to maintain the same enthalpic content.
