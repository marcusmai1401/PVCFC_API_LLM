   - Fixed: Removed all emojis, replaced with plain text
   - Status: FIXED - Compliant with user rules

2. **Windows Console Encoding**
   - Found: UnicodeEncodeError with special characters (℃, m³/h)
   - Fixed: Added UTF-8 encoding wrapper for Windows console
   - Status: FIXED

3. **Makefile Commands**
   - Found: Placeholder commands for Phase 1
   - Fixed: Updated with real executable commands
   - Status: FIXED
   ```
   make ingest-pilot    # Runs tools/extract_pilot.py
   make build-index     # Runs tools/demo_pipeline.py
   make qa-extraction   # Runs tools/qa_extraction.py
   ```

### Verification Results

#### File Structure Verification
- `app/rag/normalizers/unit_normalizer.py`: EXISTS
- `artifacts/index/bm25/`: EXISTS with all required files
  - bm25_index.pkl (19.7KB)
  - config.json (75B)
  - documents.json (16.1KB)
  - metadata.json (7.9KB)
  - tokenized_docs.pkl (13.8KB)

#### Dependencies Verification
- `requirements.txt`: Contains `rich==13.7.1`
- `requirements.txt`: Contains `tiktoken==0.7.0`
- `requirements.txt`: Contains `rank-bm25==0.2.2`

#### Report Accuracy
- Phase 1 Final Report updated to reflect:
  - Actual file sizes in artifacts
  - No emojis/icons notation
  - Working Makefile commands
  - Complete file structure

### Current Status

All Phase 1 components are:
- Fully implemented
- Tested and working
- Compliant with coding rules (no emojis/icons)
- Production-ready for vector PDFs
- Properly documented

### Next Actions

Phase 1 is 100% complete. Ready for:
1. Phase 2 planning (OCR, tables, images)
2. Production deployment of Phase 1 components
3. API endpoint development
