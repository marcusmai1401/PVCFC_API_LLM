# Bug Fixes Summary - Phase 1 Development

## Development Notes: Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Hyphenation Processing Bug
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/vector_extractor.py`
**Function:** `_fix_hyphenation`

**Problem:** 
- Original code modified the blocks list during iteration by setting `blocks[i+1] = None`
- This caused errors in subsequent iterations when trying to access `block.text` on None values

**Solution:**
- Introduced `skip_next` flag to track blocks that should be skipped
- No longer modifies the original list during iteration
- Creates new blocks for merged/remaining text
- Returns a clean list without None values

### 2. ✅ Fixed Processing Order
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/vector_extractor.py`
**Function:** `extract_from_page`

**Problem:**
- Blocks were merged before sorting, which could merge incorrect blocks
- Processing order was: extract → merge → fix_hyphenation → sort

**Solution:**
- Changed order to: extract → sort → fix_hyphenation → merge → sort again
- Ensures blocks are in reading order before merging
- Re-sorts after merging to maintain correct order

### 3. ✅ Fixed Rotation Handling
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/vector_extractor.py`
**Function:** `extract_from_page`

**Problem:**
- Code was mutating the page object with `page.set_rotation(0)`
- Returned rotation value was always 0 after mutation

**Solution:**
- Store original rotation at the start: `original_rotation = page.rotation`
- Removed the mutation call `page.set_rotation(0)`
- Return the original rotation value in results
- PyMuPDF already handles rotated pages correctly in `get_text("dict")`

## Minor Improvements

### 4. ✅ Removed Unused Import
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/vector_extractor.py`
- Removed unused `import re` statement
- Fixed duplicate `import fitz` statement

### 5. ✅ Improved Variable Naming
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/vector_extractor.py`
**Function:** `_extract_text_blocks`
- Renamed `block_num` to `span_index` for clarity
- More accurate since we're counting spans, not blocks

### 6. ✅ Added Package Init
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/__init__.py`
- Created proper package initialization
- Exports `VectorExtractor` and `TextBlock` classes
- Improves import structure and tooling support

### 7. ✅ Added Missing Logger Import
**File:** `app/rag/extractors/vector_extractor.py`
- Added `from loguru import logger` to fix error handling

## Test Results

All tests pass successfully after fixes:
- ✅ 10/10 tests pass for `test_vector_extractor.py`
- ✅ 9/9 tests pass for `test_detector.py`
- ✅ All verification tests pass in `test_fixes.py`

## Performance Impact

The fixes have minimal performance impact:
- Sorting twice adds negligible overhead for typical PDFs
- Skip flag in hyphenation is more efficient than list modification
- No page mutation improves thread safety

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: No more None value errors
2. **Immutability**: Page objects are no longer mutated
3. **Clarity**: Better variable names and structure
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner package structure with __init__.py

## Verification

Run the following to verify all fixes:
```bash
# Run unit tests
$env:PYTHONPATH="."
python -m pytest tests/test_vector_extractor.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_detector.py -v

# Run verification script
python tools/test_fixes.py

# Run demo
python tools/demo_phase1.py
```

All tests should pass without errors.
