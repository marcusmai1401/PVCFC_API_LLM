- ✅ CORS configured appropriately
- ✅ No secrets in codebase

## Recommendations for Phase 1

1. **Document Processing**: Ready to implement PDF parsing with unstructured.io
2. **Indexing**: Foundation ready for FAISS and BM25 integration
3. **Testing**: Extend test suite for new components
4. **Monitoring**: Consider adding metrics collection early

## Conclusion

**Phase 0 is 100% COMPLETE** and exceeds the original requirements. The foundation is robust, secure, and well-documented. All Definition of Done criteria have been met or exceeded.

### Summary Statistics:
- **Files created/modified**: 25+
- **Tests passing**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Code coverage**: Health endpoint 100%
